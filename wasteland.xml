                    <l>Which I am forbidden to see. I look in vain</l>
                    <l>For the Hanged Man. Fear death by water.</l>
                    <l>I see crowds of people, walking round in a ring.</l>

                    <l>Thank you. If you see dear Mrs. Equitone,</l>

                    <l>Under the brown fog of your winter dawn</l>
                    <l>A crowd flow over London Bridge, so many,</l>
                    <l>I had not thought death had undone so many.</l>
                    <l>Sighs, short and infrequent, were expired,</l>
                    <l>And each one kept his eyes before his feet.</l>
                    <l>Flowed up the hill and down King William Street,</l>
                    <l>To where Saint Mary Woolnoth kept the time,</l>
                    <l>With a dead sound on the final stroke of nine.</l>
                    <l>There I saw one I knew, and stopped him, crying: "Stetson! </l>
                    <l>"You who were with me in the ships at Mylae!</l>
                    <l>"That corpse you planted last year in your garden,</l>
                    <l>"Has it begun to sprout? Will it bloom this year?"</l>
                    <l>"Or has the sudden frost disturbed its bed?"</l>
                    <l>"Oh keep the Dog far hence, that's foe to men,</l>
                    <l>"Or with his nails he'll dig it up again!</l>
                    <l>"You! hypocrite lecteur, -mon semblable,-mon frère!"</l>
